![](readme_assets/Gnome%2040.png)
- The current workspace will be bigger and centered
- Beautiful transitions. 
    - Window transitions will have a bit of a delay compared to workspaces
- All windows can be moved even without being inside the magnified / in-use workspace
- When the Show applications button is pressed, the magnified / in-use workspace will move up with the rest, leaving free space for 
the application grid
